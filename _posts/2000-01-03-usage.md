# Simple to use

Using the module is pretty straight-forward. To import it just do:

```python
>>> import dbcollection as dbc
```

To load a dataset, you only need to use a single method that returns a data loader object which can then be used to fetch data from.

```python
>>> mnist = dbc.load('mnist')
```

This data loader object contains information
about the dataset's name, task, data, cache paths, set splits, and some methods for querying and loading data from the `HDF5` metadata file.

For example, if you want to know how the data is structured inside the metadata file, you can simply do the following:

{% highlight python %}
>>> mnist.info()

> Set: test
   - classes,        shape = (10, 2),          dtype = uint8
   - images,         shape = (10000, 28, 28),  dtype = uint8,  (in 'object_ids', position = 0)
   - labels,         shape = (10000,),         dtype = uint8,  (in 'object_ids', position = 1)
   - object_fields,  shape = (2, 7),           dtype = uint8
   - object_ids,     shape = (10000, 2),       dtype = uint8

   (Pre-ordered lists)
   - list_images_per_class,  shape = (10, 1135),  dtype = int32

> Set: train
   - classes,        shape = (10, 2),          dtype = uint8
   - images,         shape = (60000, 28, 28),  dtype = uint8,  (in 'object_ids', position = 0)
   - labels,         shape = (60000,),         dtype = uint8,  (in 'object_ids', position = 1)
   - object_fields,  shape = (2, 7),           dtype = uint8
   - object_ids,     shape = (60000, 2),       dtype = uint8

   (Pre-ordered lists)
   - list_images_per_class,  shape = (10, 6742),  dtype = int32

{% endhighlight %}

To fetch data samples from a field, its is as easy as calling a method with the set and field names and the row id(s) you want to select. For example, to retrieve the 10 first images all you need to do is the following:

{% highlight python %}
>>> imgs = mnist.get('train', 'images', range(10))
>>> imgs.shape
(10, 28, 28)
{% endhighlight %}
