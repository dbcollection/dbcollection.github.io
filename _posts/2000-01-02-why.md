# Why use dbcollection?

dbcollection provides a cross-platform, cross-language framework to manage datasets, quickly load/fetch data with minimal resources wasted and a list of diverse datasets to work with.

The main goal of this project is to help save time for users when developing/deploying/sharing code.

## Reasons why you should use dbcollection

Here are some of the problems dbcollection tries to solve:

- Downloading, extracting and parsing different datasets without prior knowledge of their inner workings is error prone.
- Constantly writting the same boilerplate code or adapting existing one for newprojects.
- Moving to a new language meant a complete re-writte the same code for loading/parsing datasets.
- Disk space can get littered with cached data everywhere as you work on different projects.
- Wasted time and computer resources (mostly memory) when loading large datasets.
- `.json` format, while fine for smaller datasets, is not an efficient solution to store large amounts of (meta)data for large datasets.
- Using a new dataset means you have to spend a significant part of time learning how to use it in order to be able to load/parse it (and good luck if they use some obscure, in house format that can only be extracted by using a specific toolbox).
- learning how to use other peopleâ€™s toolboxes is a tedious (and sometimes difficult) task, specially if they are written in one or more different languages.
